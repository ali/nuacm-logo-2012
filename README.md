Fork This Design
================

[NUacm][acm] is having another logo design contest. The winner gets free
ACM swag -- a shirt, stickers, and a "votive candle holder" -- along
with the pride of 100 students at Northeastern's College of Computer
and Information Science wearing your design.

This is a **"[Fork][fork] This Design"** contest, meaning you're encouraged to
work off of other designs (including the current logo), but you're
allowed to do your own completely new thing if you want.
